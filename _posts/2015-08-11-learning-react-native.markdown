React-native is really cool framework to write iOS application with frontend technology, such as Javascript and CSS.

Althogh I have been working on web for almost ten years, I'm still not good at Javascript and CSS, so I've to learn these which are difficult.

React-native uses the concept of CSS flex box layout. Flex box layout seems quite simple to learn, but only after I solved a problem I know:

> flexDirection should be on containers and flex should be on children.[https://medium.com/@realasa/my-adventures-with-react-native-36c354249109]

Another problem is using Images.xcassets. I have imported images into Xcode project, but application will always crash with image not found.

Then resolution is rename the image file name same as the image set's name.

Now I'm trying to build prototype with the design, it looks well after I fixed those problems.

React native is really productive tool for the developer.
